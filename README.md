# Yandex_Praktikum_translated_into_English
Here are three my projects in jupyter notebook translated in English, which I did in 2020, during my studies at Yandex.Praktikum. I worked using such Python libraries as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy.
First project was about Moscow catering. The study of the market of catering in Moscow is carried out by order of potential investors of a business project, within the framework of which it is supposed to organize a cafe or a chain of cafes, where robots will be used instead of service personnel. The purpose of this analysis is to find out what main niches exist in the restaurant business today, what is typical for them (what type of distribution, what areas, how many seats, etc.). The ultimate goal of the project is to give recommendations to customers and to summarize the main conclusions of the analysis of the current state of affairs in the market.
The second one was about mobile application of grocery store. This project investigates the behavior of users of a grocery store mobile application. We are faced with two tasks: the study of the funnel of events and the study of the results of the A / A / B test. Users of the experimental group use a version of the application with modified fonts. How does this affect their behavior compared to users in control groups?
And the third one was about Yandex.Afisha service. It examined cost effectiveness of advertisements of it.
